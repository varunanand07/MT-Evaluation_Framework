        "captions": "It is so great being up on here.\nI also want to make sure I commemorate\nand take a quick TED selfie.\nHold on, sorry, don't mind me.\nWhat was my best selfie angle again?\nAnyone else have that question?\nA few, a few, OK.\nWell, it's a question I get asked\nall the time as a posing coach.\nAnd it's so silly\nbecause it's really simple,\nthere's chin up and chin down.\nMatter of fact, can we try\nthis from our seats real quick?\nEveryone just do a simple chin up.\nLet me take a look.\nAlright, OK.\nLet me try to figure this out\nfor everyone here.\nChin down.\nYeah, great, OK\nHow does everyone look good\nin both angles?\n(Laughter)\nBut before I go on to solve\nthe world's mystery of selfies\nfor you today,\nlet's address the elephant\nin the room, shall we?\nBecause I have a feeling\nthat not everyone here\nis so deeply invested in taking\nthe cutest selfie every day.\nBut that's OK, that's OK.\nThis is still going to be good\nbecause I'll take a bet in saying\nthat every single one of you here\ndeserves a powerful headshot\nthat not only reflects your identity\nbut your ambition and success.\nFor the past decade, \nI've been photographing\nover thousands of people.\nA few you may recognize.\nCelebrities.\nCEOs.\nBut mainly people.\nPeople like you and me\nwho have a simple human desire\nto be seen and heard.\nAnd there's something\nthis external-validation-seeking\nculture of selfies\nthat I learned\nthat this culture hasn't taught me.\nIt's that posing for a photo\ndoesn't have to be\nthis terrifying experience\nthat subjects you to beauty standards.\nIn fact, posing should be natural\nbecause it's something\nthat you've been speaking.\nIt's a language you've been\nspeaking your entire life.\nBody language.\nAnd I'm here to show you\nthat our body is so interconnected\nwith our hearts and our identity.\nTake a look this time,\nlet me just show you, OK?\nI'll say a little hello from here,\nand then a little chin up and, hey.\nAnd then also a little chin down and, hey.\n(Laughter)\nWhoa.\nWhat just happened?\nPerhaps on the chin-up,\nyou felt a sense of confidence.\nMaybe on the chin-down,\nyou felt like I was flirting\nwith you from the stage.\nI told you, everyone looks so good here.\nBut how does something so mechanical\nstart to express emotions?\nIt's not voodoo magic\nbecause this is something\nthat we can all do.\nMatter of fact, let's try this\nall together one more time.\nEveryone, this time just relax\nyour shoulders with me, yeah.\nLet's take a deep breath through your nose\nand out through the mouth.\nBeautiful.\nChin up, very slowly with me,\nfeeling powerful.\nBack down to neutral.\nChin down just a touch,\nhead tilt to the side,\nnose around slightly,\nand just the eyes down\ntowards the ground beneath you.\nAnd just the eyes again,\nslowly bringing up back to me.\nOoh, OK.\n(Laughter)\nIf you felt something in here\nin your body, my friends,\nyou felt a fraction\nof the power of posing.\nJust using your chin up.\nImagine what you can do\nwhen you use your entire body.\nBy the end of this talk,\nI want to show you\nthat you can become\nwhoever you want to become\nthrough a single pose.\nBut how did David get here,\nwhere he can orchestrate a whole room\nfull of beautiful people\nto just flirt with him\nin a matter of seconds?\n(Laughter)\nIt started in high school.\nNot the flirting.\nIt was a passion, it was a simple passion\nof taking a photo for someone else\nthat they would love.\nAnd it's an honorable passion.\nBut there was a big problem.\nPosing.\nDavid, what do I do with my hands?\nDon't look at me,\nI'm just a shy Korean kid\nhiding behind his camera.\n(Laughter)\nI know, it's very cute, very cute.\n(Laughter)\nBut because they didn't know how to pose,\nthey felt awkward,\ntherefore, they looked awkward.\nAnd then they saw the awkward photo\nwhere they said, \"Oh,\nonce again, I look awkward.\"\nFurther validating their limiting beliefs.\nBut it's OK because high-school\nDavid had a solution.\nHe went to Google and typed in\n\"top three poses for a woman.\"\nThe guys in the high school\ndidn't want photos that much.\nSo David memorized pose one.\nPose two.\nAnd pose three.\n(Laughter)\nEasy peasy, right?\nNope.\nBecause David learned that everyone\nhas different body types.\nI mean, how can he --\nOK, that makes sense.\nBut what if David learns\nthe top three poses\nfor every conceivable body type\nout there in the universe?\nSurely he would be\nset up for success, right?\nNope.\nBecause even if two people\nhave the same body types,\nhow they perceive themselves\nand how they want to be seen\ncan be drastically different.\nThis is a problem with today's\ndefinition of posing.\nIt boxes you in\nbased on your physical\ntraits and your labels.\nAh, you are a woman,\nthis is how you need to present your body.\nYeah, let's not get cancelled\non the TED stage my first time here.\n(Laughter)\nThat's me, by the way.\n(Laughter)\nThere's a client that taught me\nthis lesson really well.\nShe was an ex dominatrix, now author.\nI know, really cool.\nSo she was getting her hair and makeup\ndone, and I went over and I said,\n\"Miss Client, how would you like\nto be photographed today?\"\nShe looked dead straight at me and said,\n\"David, I want to be a bisexual assassin.\"\n(Laughter)\n\"Yeah, let's do that.\"\nAnd as I slowly walked out\nof the makeup room,\nimmense panic just -- whew.\nWhat does that even mean?\nDavid went to his laptop and typed\n\"top three poses for bisexual assassins.\"\nImmediately regretted it.\n(Laughter)\nEventually, I had no other options.\nI had to trust my process.\nSo David guided her limb by limb,\nintentionally, to feel within her body.\nAnd I nervously presented\na photo to her, and she said,\n\"David, this is me.\"\nI learned that day --\nThank you, thank you.\n(Applause)\nI learned that day that it wasn't my job\nto teach her how to be\na bisexual assassin.\nAll I had to do was give her space\nto be who she already was.\nThe baddest bisexual\nassassin in the world.\nIt's not about contorting your body\nto fit someone else's idea of you.\nIt also doesn't matter if you see\na version of what you believe\nis bisexual assassin here or not,\nbecause Krista connected with herself.\nThat is what posing is.\nIt's a declaration of self.\nTelling the world that you belong,\nthat you are deserving\nof self-exploration,\nself acceptance and self expression.\nA playful promise to tell yourself\nthat I will see myself as a work of art,\na one of one.\nSo with that being said -- thank you --\nLet's make this declaration together.\nI invite you all.\nI'm going to grab\nmy trusty chair here real quick.\nLike, what is going on?\nLet me just ...\nLet's make this declaration\nthrough what I call posing yoga, poga.\nI'm going to be your mirror.\nSo if you wave at me real quick,\nthis should be your left hand.\nJust mirror, mirror.\nYep, I should be able to go up\nto you and high five, right?\nWe're going to embody\nthe leaders that we are\nand the leaders that we are becoming.\nSo first, starting with everyone\nthat has skirts on.\nBeing mindful, right?\nSit on the edge of the seat for me.\nJust the people with the skirts.\nI'm going to have you go\nfor a little leg cross.\nThis hand leaning towards the knee.\nFeel that shift of the balance\nonto that knee relaxing this wrist,\nthis hand just placing\non top of that wrist.\nBring your shoulder around ever\nso slightly towards your chin.\nAnd wait for me right here.\nEveryone else in the trousers\nand the pants,\nlet's still sit on the edge of the seat\nand go for a wider stance on the legs.\nBe mindful of your neighbors.\nLet’s go for a little tippy toe\nto raise this platform on the knee.\nAnd this hand we’re going to lean over,\nreally shifting that balance.\nRely on your body, relax that wrist.\nThis hand we're just going\nto go right over here.\nAnd everyone with me,\nlet's bring our chin up ever so slightly.\nDeep breath in through the nose\nand out through the mouth.\nAnd just the eyes to me.\nI wish I can take a photo\nof everyone right now.\n(Laughter)\nEnd scene, you can relax.\n(Applause)\nThis is how posing should feel.\nIt should feel grounding.\nIt should feel empowering.\nAnd this is how the shy Korean kid\nthat you saw earlier on\ncame to be him today.\nMe on stage.\n(Applause and cheers)\nI mean, don't get me wrong,\nboth Davids are beautiful.\nBut this David saw posing\nas a tool to look good,\nto almost pretend.\nMe now, I see posing as a way\nto embody who I've become\nand who I'm destined to become.\nSo the next time you are\nin front of the camera,\nwhether it's for a selfie or a headshot,\nplease remember that you deserve\nto take up space,\nshift your balance to comfort your body,\nand remember David asking you,\nhow are you and your future self\nshowing up for you today in your body?\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.\n(Applause and cheers)",

many people have the experience\nthat when they speak, people\ndon't listen to them.\nAnd why is that?\nHow can we speak powerfully\nto make change in the world?\nWhat I'd like to suggest,\nthere are a number of habits\nthat we need to move away from.\nI've assembled for your pleasure here\nseven deadly sins of speaking.\nI'm not pretending\nthis is an exhaustive list,\nbut these seven, I think, are pretty large\nhabits that we can all fall into.\nFirst, gossip.\nSpeaking ill of somebody\nwho's not present.\nNot a nice habit,\nand we know perfectly well\nthe person gossiping, five minutes later,\nwill be gossiping about us.\nSecond, judging.\nWe know people who are like this\nin conversation,\nand it's very hard to listen to somebody\nif you know that you're being judged\nand found wanting at the same time.\nThird, negativity.\nYou can fall into this.\nMy mother, in the last years of her life,\nbecame very negative,\nand it's hard to listen.\nI remember one day, I said to her,\n\"It's October 1 today,\"\nand she said, \"I know, isn't it dreadful?\"\n(Laughter)\nIt's hard to listen\nwhen somebody's that negative.\n(Laughter)\nAnd another form\nof negativity, complaining.\nWell, this is the national art of the U.K.\nIt's our national sport.\nWe complain about the weather, sport,\nabout politics, about everything,\nbut actually, complaining is viral misery.\nIt's not spreading sunshine\nand lightness in the world.\nExcuses.\nWe've all met this guy.\nMaybe we've all been this guy.\nSome people have a blamethrower.\nThey just pass it on to everybody else\nand don't take responsibility\nfor their actions,\nand again, hard to listen\nto somebody who is being like that.\nPenultimate, the sixth of the seven,\nembroidery, exaggeration.\nIt demeans our language,\nactually, sometimes.\nFor example, if I see something\nthat really is awesome,\nwhat do I call it?\n(Laughter)\nAnd then, of course,\nthis exaggeration becomes lying,\nand we don't want to listen\nto people we know are lying to us.\nAnd finally, dogmatism.\nThe confusion of facts with opinions.\nWhen those two things get conflated,\nyou're listening into the wind.\nYou know, somebody is bombarding you\nwith their opinions as if they were true.\nIt's difficult to listen to that.\nSo here they are, seven deadly\nsins of speaking.\nThese are things I think we need to avoid.\nBut is there a positive\nway to think about this?\nYes, there is.\nI'd like to suggest that there are four\nreally powerful cornerstones, foundations,\nthat we can stand on if we want our speech\nto be powerful and to make\nchange in the world.\nFortunately, these things spell a word.\nThe word is \"hail,\" and it has\na great definition as well.\nI'm not talking about the stuff\nthat falls from the sky\nand hits you on the head.\nI'm talking about this definition,\nto greet or acclaim enthusiastically,\nwhich is how I think\nour words will be received\nif we stand on these four things.\nSo what do they stand for?\nSee if you can guess.\nThe H, honesty, of course,\nbeing true in what you say,\nbeing straight and clear.\nThe A is authenticity,\njust being yourself.\nA friend of mine described it as\nstanding in your own truth,\nwhich I think is a lovely way to put it.\nThe I is integrity, being your word,\nactually doing what you say,\nand being somebody people can trust.\nAnd the L is love.\nI don't mean romantic love,\nbut I do mean wishing people\nwell, for two reasons.\nFirst of all, I think absolute honesty\nmay not be what we want.\nI mean, my goodness,\nyou look ugly this morning.\nPerhaps that's not necessary.\nTempered with love, of course,\nhonesty is a great thing.\nBut also, if you're really\nwishing somebody well,\nit's very hard to judge\nthem at the same time.\nI'm not even sure you can do\nthose two things simultaneously.\nSo hail.\nAlso, now that's what you say,\nand it's like the old song,\nit is what you say,\nit's also the way that you say it.\nYou have an amazing toolbox.\nThis instrument is incredible,\nand yet this is a toolbox\nthat very few people have ever opened.\nI'd like to have a little rummage\nin there with you now\nand just pull a few tools out\nthat you might like to take\naway and play with,\nwhich will increase\nthe power of your speaking.\nRegister, for example.\nNow, falsetto register may not\nbe very useful most of the time,\nbut there's a register in between.\nI'm not going to get very\ntechnical about this\nfor any of you who are voice coaches.\nYou can locate your voice, however.\nSo if I talk up here in my nose,\nyou can hear the difference.\nIf I go down here in my throat,\nwhich is where most of us\nspeak from most of the time.\nBut if you want weight,\nyou need to go down here to the chest.\nYou hear the difference?\nWe vote for politicians\nwith lower voices, it's true,\nbecause we associate depth with power\nand with authority.\nThat's register.\nThen we have timbre.\nIt's the way your voice feels.\nAgain, the research shows\nthat we prefer voices\nwhich are rich, smooth, warm,\nlike hot chocolate.\nWell if that's not you,\nthat's not the end of the world,\nbecause you can train.\nGo and get a voice coach.\nAnd there are amazing things you can do\nwith breathing, with posture,\nand with exercises\nto improve the timbre of your voice.\nThen prosody. I love prosody.\nThis is the sing-song, the meta-language\nthat we use in order to impart meaning.\nIt's root one for meaning in conversation.\nPeople who speak all on one note\nare really quite hard to listen to\nif they don't have any prosody at all.\nThat's where the word\n\"monotonic\" comes from,\nor monotonous, monotone.\nAlso, we have repetitive\nprosody now coming in,\nwhere every sentence ends\nas if it were a question\nwhen it's actually not\na question, it's a statement?\n(Laughter)\nAnd if you repeat that one,\nit's actually restricting your ability\nto communicate through prosody,\nwhich I think is a shame,\nso let's try and break that habit.\nPace.\nI can get very excited by saying\nsomething really quickly,\nor I can slow right down to emphasize,\nand at the end of that, of course,\nis our old friend silence.\nThere's nothing wrong with a bit\nof silence in a talk, is there?\nWe don't have to fill it with ums and ahs.\nIt can be very powerful.\nOf course, pitch often\ngoes along with pace\nto indicate arousal, but you\ncan do it just with pitch.\nWhere did you leave my keys?\n(Higher pitch) Where did you\nleave my keys?\nSo, slightly different meaning\nin those two deliveries.\nAnd finally, volume.\n(Loud) I can get really excited\nby using volume.\nSorry about that, if I startled anybody.\nOr, I can have you really pay attention\nby getting very quiet.\nSome people broadcast the whole time.\nTry not to do that.\nThat's called sodcasting,\n(Laughter)\nImposing your sound on people around you\ncarelessly and inconsiderately.\nNot nice.\nOf course, where this all comes\ninto play most of all\nis when you've got something\nreally important to do.\nIt might be standing on a stage like this\nand giving a talk to people.\nIt might be proposing marriage,\nasking for a raise, a wedding speech.\nWhatever it is, if it's really important,\nyou owe it to yourself\nto look at this toolbox\nand the engine that it's going to work on,\nand no engine works well\nwithout being warmed up.\nWarm up your voice.\nActually, let me show you how to do that.\nWould you all like to stand\nup for a moment?\nI'm going to show you\nthe six vocal warm-up exercises\nthat I do before every talk I ever do.\nAny time you're going to talk\nto anybody important, do these.\nFirst, arms up, deep breath in,\nand sigh out, ahhhhh, like that.\nOne more time.\nAhhhh, very good.\nNow we're going to warm up our lips,\nand we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba,\nBa, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good.\nAnd now, brrrrrrrrrr,\njust like when you were a kid.\nBrrrr. Now your lips\nshould be coming alive.\nWe're going to do the tongue next\nwith exaggerated la, la, la,\nla, la, la, la, la, la.\nBeautiful. You're getting\nreally good at this.\nAnd then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr.\nThat's like champagne for the tongue.\nFinally, and if I can only do one,\nthe pros call this the siren.\nIt's really good. It starts\nwith \"we\" and goes to \"aw.\"\nThe \"we\" is high, the \"aw\" is low.\nSo you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.\nFantastic. Give yourselves\na round of applause.\nTake a seat, thank you.\n(Applause)\nNext time you speak, do those in advance.\nNow let me just put this\nin context to close.\nThis is a serious point here.\nThis is where we are now, right?\nWe speak not very well\nto people who simply aren't listening\nin an environment that's all\nabout noise and bad acoustics.\nI have talked about that on this stage\nin different phases.\nWhat would the world be like\nif we were speaking powerfully\nto people who were listening consciously\nin environments which were\nactually fit for purpose?\nOr to make that a bit larger,\nwhat would the world be like\nif we were creating sound consciously\nand consuming sound consciously\nand designing all our environments\nconsciously for sound?\nThat would be a world\nthat does sound beautiful,\nand one where understanding\nwould be the norm,\nand that is an idea worth spreading.\nThank you.\n(Applause)",

Hulu stopped\nworking which is actually not even true\nthe account that i' had been mooching\noff of reset their password so I\ncouldn't get\nin\nokay and I probably could have gotten my\nown but that would have required focus\nfocus and\nenergy so here I was 6 to8 hours of a\nday of nursing or\npumping with no love\nIsland\nokay I was so addicted to the show that\nI didn't even know where to start\nreplacing that kind of dopamine\nhit so I didn't I just sat there for\nhours and I didn't do anything in\nparticular I just remember being\nprofoundly and existentially\nbored and that continued for\ndays until something weirder happened my\nbrain which had been reduced to Absolute\noatmeal during this period of time\nseemed to reset I started thinking about\ncreative ways to spend my time I started\nbrainstorming how to get more people\nbetter access to good sound information\non Mental Health Care I started to\nresearch imagine then create educational\ncontent around that I put some of those\nvideos online and before I knew it I had\nover a million followers across\nplatforms because of those videos I was\noffered a book deal I was able to\ndevelop an ADHD management app I was\nasked by the Vice President and the\nSurgeon General to speak about burnout\nand all of those things\nhappened because my Hulu stopped\nworking all of those things happened\nbecause I was stuck to the couch with a\ndull routine all of that happened\nbecause I was\nbored now most of my content and\neducational research is about ADHD I\nhave it and I treat it so I spent a lot\nof my time focusing on focus and I\nstarted to wonder\nwhy was there such a seismic shift in my\nfocus and I'll tell\nyou it's because I allowed myself to be\nbored the true secret to dialing\nin is being able

actually use\nall of it even when you're sleeping your\nbrain is always\nactive so when you're awake alert\nfocused on a task you're constantly\nbeing ripped in a million different\ndirections by distractions and that's\nnot even an ADHD specific thing that's a\nhuman in this modern world\nthing so when you attempt a\nmultitask you're not actually doing more\nthan one activity at a time instead\nyou're rapidly shifting your Focus from\none thing to another using up oxygenated\nglucose in the brain which is exactly\nthe fuel you need when you're trying to\nfocus so here you are burning through\nyour resources and it's even harder to\nstay on task for a prolonged period of\ntime so you jump from task to task even\nmore and you use up more glucose and you\nkeep jumping and it goes on and on and\nyou get stuck on this vicious cycle of\nbrain fatigue\nand it's\nexhausting so how do we exit that\nLoop when you allow your brain to quiet\ndown you activate lesser known neural\nPathways called the default mode Network\nand I would describe that neurologically\nbut it's a relatively recent concept\nthere's not even a complete consensus on\nall the brain regions

two\nparts of\nourselves the focus task performing part\nthat helps us achieve solve problems\nmake a living and the daydreamy space\npart that restores us makes us feel\nalive when those two\nparts

        "captions": "So in college,\nI was a government major,\nwhich means I had to write\na lot of papers.\nNow, when a normal student writes a paper,\nthey might spread the work out\na little like this.\nSo, you know --\n(Laughter)\nyou get started maybe a little slowly,\nbut you get enough done in the first week\nthat, with some heavier days later on,\neverything gets done, things stay civil.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I would want to do that like that.\nThat would be the plan.\nI would have it all ready to go,\nbut then, actually, the paper\nwould come along,\nand then I would kind of do this.\n(Laughter)\nAnd that would happen every single paper.\nBut then came my 90-page senior thesis,\na paper you're supposed\nto spend a year on.\nAnd I knew for a paper like that,\nmy normal work flow was not an option.\nIt was way too big a project.\nSo I planned things out,\nand I decided I kind of had\nto go something like this.\nThis is how the year would go.\nSo I'd start off light,\nand I'd bump it up in the middle months,\nand then at the end,\nI would kick it up into high gear\njust like a little staircase.\nHow hard could it be\nto walk up the stairs?\nNo big deal, right?\nBut then, the funniest thing happened.\nThose first few months?\nThey came and went,\nand I couldn't quite do stuff.\nSo we had an awesome new revised plan.\n(Laughter)\nAnd then --\n(Laughter)\nBut then those middle months\nactually went by,\nand I didn't really write words,\nand so we were here.\nAnd then two months turned into one month,\nwhich turned into two weeks.\nAnd one day I woke up\nwith three days until the deadline,\nstill not having written a word,\nand so I did the only thing I could:\nI wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,\npulling not one but two all-nighters --\nhumans are not supposed to pull\ntwo all-nighters --\nsprinted across campus,\ndove in slow motion,\nand got it in just at the deadline.\nI thought that was the end of everything.\nBut a week later I get a call,\nand it's the school.\nAnd they say, \"Is this Tim Urban?\"\nAnd I say, \"Yeah.\"\nAnd they say, \"We need\nto talk about your thesis.\"\nAnd I say, \"OK.\"\nAnd they say,\n\"It's the best one we've ever seen.\"\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nThat did not happen.\n(Laughter)\nIt was a very, very bad thesis.\n(Laughter)\nI just wanted to enjoy that one moment\nwhen all of you thought,\n\"This guy is amazing!\"\n(Laughter)\nNo, no, it was very, very bad.\nAnyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.\nI write the blog Wait But Why.\nAnd a couple of years ago,\nI decided to write about procrastination.\nMy behavior has always perplexed\nthe non-procrastinators around me,\nand I wanted to explain\nto the non-procrastinators of the world\nwhat goes on in the heads\nof procrastinators,\nand why we are the way we are.\nNow, I had a hypothesis\nthat the brains of procrastinators\nwere actually different\nthan the brains of other people.\nAnd to test this, I found an MRI lab\nthat actually let me scan both my brain\nand the brain of a proven\nnon-procrastinator,\nso I could compare them.\nI actually brought them here\nto show you today.\nI want you to take a look carefully\nto see if you can notice a difference.\nI know that if you're not\na trained brain expert,\nit's not that obvious,\nbut just take a look, OK?\nSo here's the brain\nof a non-procrastinator.\n(Laughter)\nNow ...\nhere's my brain.\n(Laughter)\nThere is a difference.\nBoth brains have a Rational\nDecision-Maker in them,\nbut the procrastinator's brain\nalso has an Instant Gratification Monkey.\nNow, what does this mean\nfor the procrastinator?\nWell, it means everything's fine\nuntil this happens.\n[This is a perfect time\nto get some work done.] [Nope!]\nSo the Rational Decision-Maker\nwill make the rational decision\nto do something productive,\nbut the Monkey doesn't like that plan,\nso he actually takes the wheel,\nand he says, \"Actually, let's read\nthe entire Wikipedia page\nof the Nancy Kerrigan/\nTonya Harding scandal,\nbecause I just remembered\nthat that happened.\n(Laughter)\nThen --\n(Laughter)\nThen we're going to go over to the fridge,\nto see if there's anything new\nin there since 10 minutes ago.\nAfter that, we're going to go\non a YouTube spiral\nthat starts with videos\nof Richard Feynman talking about magnets\nand ends much, much later\nwith us watching interviews\nwith Justin Bieber's mom.\n(Laughter)\n\"All of that's going to take a while,\nso we're not going to really have room\non the schedule for any work today.\nSorry!\"\n(Sigh)\nNow, what is going on here?\nThe Instant Gratification Monkey\ndoes not seem like a guy\nyou want behind the wheel.\nHe lives entirely in the present moment.\nHe has no memory of the past,\nno knowledge of the future,\nand he only cares about two things:\neasy and fun.\nNow, in the animal world, that works fine.\nIf you're a dog\nand you spend your whole life doing\nnothing other than easy and fun things,\nyou're a huge success!\n(Laughter)\nAnd to the Monkey,\nhumans are just another animal species.\nYou have to keep well-slept, well-fed\nand propagating into the next generation,\nwhich in tribal times\nmight have worked OK.\nBut, if you haven't noticed,\nnow we're not in tribal times.\nWe're in an advanced civilization,\nand the Monkey does not know what that is.\nWhich is why we have\nanother guy in our brain,\nthe Rational Decision-Maker,\nwho gives us the ability to do things\nno other animal can do.\nWe can visualize the future.\nWe can see the big picture.\nWe can make long-term plans.\nAnd he wants to take\nall of that into account.\nAnd he wants to just have us do\nwhatever makes sense\nto be doing right now.\nNow, sometimes it makes sense\nto be doing things that are easy and fun,\nlike when you're having dinner\nor going to bed\nor enjoying well-earned leisure time.\nThat's why there's an overlap.\nSometimes they agree.\nBut other times, it makes much more sense\nto be doing things that are harder\nand less pleasant,\nfor the sake of the big picture.\nAnd that's when we have a conflict.\nAnd for the procrastinator,\nthat conflict tends to end\na certain way every time,\nleaving him spending a lot of time\nin this orange zone,\nan easy and fun place that's entirely\nout of the Makes Sense circle.\nI call it the Dark Playground.\n(Laughter)\nNow, the Dark Playground is a place\nthat all of you procrastinators\nout there know very well.\nIt's where leisure activities happen\nat times when leisure activities\nare not supposed to be happening.\nThe fun you have in the Dark Playground\nisn't actually fun,\nbecause it's completely unearned,\nand the air is filled with guilt,\ndread, anxiety, self-hatred --\nall of those good procrastinator feelings.\nAnd the question is, in this situation,\nwith the Monkey behind the wheel,\nhow does the procrastinator ever get\nhimself over here to this blue zone,\na less pleasant place, but where\nreally important things happen?\nWell, turns out the procrastinator\nhas a guardian angel,\nsomeone who's always looking\ndown on him and watching over him\nin his darkest moments --\nsomeone called the Panic Monster.\n(Laughter)\nNow, the Panic Monster\nis dormant most of the time,\nbut he suddenly wakes up\nanytime a deadline gets too close\nor there's danger of public embarrassment,\na career disaster or some other\nscary consequence.\nAnd importantly, he's the only thing\nthe Monkey is terrified of.\nNow, he became very relevant\nin my life pretty recently,\nbecause the people of TED\nreached out to me about six months ago\nand invited me to do a TED Talk.\n(Laughter)\nNow, of course, I said yes.\nIt's always been a dream of mine\nto have done a TED Talk in the past.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nBut in the middle of all this excitement,\nthe Rational Decision-Maker seemed\nto have something else on his mind.\nHe was saying, \"Are we clear\non what we just accepted?\nDo we get what's going to be now\nhappening one day in the future?\nWe need to sit down\nand work on this right now.\"\nAnd the Monkey said, \"Totally agree,\nbut let's just open Google Earth\nand zoom in to the bottom of India,\nlike 200 feet above the ground,\nand scroll up for two and a half hours\ntil we get to the top of the country,\nso we can get a better feel for India.\"\n(Laughter)\nSo that's what we did that day.\n(Laughter)\nAs six months turned into four\nand then two and then one,\nthe people of TED decided\nto release the speakers.\nAnd I opened up the website,\nand there was my face\nstaring right back at me.\nAnd guess who woke up?\n(Laughter)\nSo the Panic Monster\nstarts losing his mind,\nand a few seconds later,\nthe whole system's in mayhem.\n(Laughter)\nAnd the Monkey -- remember,\nhe's terrified of the Panic Monster --\nboom, he's up the tree!\nAnd finally,\nfinally, the Rational Decision-Maker\ncan take the wheel\nand I can start working on the talk.\nNow, the Panic Monster explains\nall kinds of pretty insane\nprocrastinator behavior,\nlike how someone like me\ncould spend two weeks\nunable to start the opening\nsentence of a paper,\nand then miraculously find\nthe unbelievable work ethic\nto stay up all night\nand write eight pages.\nAnd this entire situation,\nwith the three characters --\nthis is the procrastinator's system.\nIt's not pretty, but in the end, it works.\nThis is what I decided to write about\non the blog a couple of years ago.\nWhen I did, I was amazed by the response.\nLiterally thousands of emails came in,\nfrom all different kinds of people\nfrom all over the world,\ndoing all different kinds of things.\nThese are people who were nurses,\nbankers, painters, engineers\nand lots and lots of PhD students.\n(Laughter)\nAnd they were all writing,\nsaying the same thing:\n\"I have this problem too.\"\nBut what struck me was the contrast\nbetween the light tone of the post\nand the heaviness of these emails.\nThese people were writing\nwith intense frustration\nabout what procrastination\nhad done to their lives,\nabout what this Monkey had done to them.\nAnd I thought about this, and I said,\nwell, if the procrastinator's system\nworks, then what's going on?\nWhy are all of these people\nin such a dark place?\nWell, it turns out that there's\ntwo kinds of procrastination.\nEverything I've talked about today,\nthe examples I've given,\nthey all have deadlines.\nAnd when there's deadlines,\nthe effects of procrastination\nare contained to the short term\nbecause the Panic Monster gets involved.\nBut there's a second kind\nof procrastination\nthat happens in situations\nwhen there is no deadline.\nSo if you wanted a career\nwhere you're a self-starter --\nsomething in the arts,\nsomething entrepreneurial --\nthere's no deadlines on those things\nat first, because nothing's happening,\nnot until you've gone out\nand done the hard work\nto get momentum, get things going.\nThere's also all kinds of important things\noutside of your career\nthat don't involve any deadlines,\nlike seeing your family or exercising\nand taking care of your health,\nworking on your relationship\nor getting out of a relationship\nthat isn't working.\nNow if the procrastinator's only mechanism\nof doing these hard things\nis the Panic Monster, that's a problem,\nbecause in all of these\nnon-deadline situations,\nthe Panic Monster doesn't show up.\nHe has nothing to wake up for,\nso the effects of procrastination,\nthey're not contained;\nthey just extend outward forever.\nAnd it's this long-term\nkind of procrastination\nthat's much less visible\nand much less talked about\nthan the funnier, short-term\ndeadline-based kind.\nIt's usually suffered\nquietly and privately.\nAnd it can be the source\nof a huge amount of long-term\nunhappiness, and regrets.\nAnd I thought, that's why\nthose people are emailing,\nand that's why they're\nin such a bad place.\nIt's not that they're cramming\nfor some project.\nIt's that long-term procrastination\nhas made them feel like a spectator,\nat times, in their own lives.\nThe frustration is not\nthat they couldn't achieve their dreams;\nit's that they weren't even\nable to start chasing them.\nSo I read these emails\nand I had a little bit of an epiphany --\nthat I don't think\nnon-procrastinators exist.\nThat's right -- I think all of you\nare procrastinators.\nNow, you might not all be a mess,\nlike some of us,\n(Laughter)\nand some of you may have\na healthy relationship with deadlines,\nbut remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick\nis when the deadlines aren't there.\nNow, I want to show you one last thing.\nI call this a Life Calendar.\nThat's one box for every week\nof a 90-year life.\nThat's not that many boxes,\nespecially since we've already\nused a bunch of those.\nSo I think we need to all take a long,\nhard look at that calendar.\nWe need to think about what\nwe're really procrastinating on,\nbecause everyone is procrastinating\non something in life.\nWe need to stay aware\nof the Instant Gratification Monkey.\nThat's a job for all of us.\nAnd because there's not\nthat many boxes on there,\nit's a job that should\nprobably start today.\nWell, maybe not today, but ...\n(Laughter)\nYou know.\nSometime soon.\nThank you.\n(Applause)",

supposed to pull\ntwo all-nighters --\nsprinted across campus,\ndove in slow motion,\nand got it in just at the deadline.\nI thought that was the end of everything.\nBut a week later I get a call,\nand it's the school.\nAnd they say, \"Is this Tim Urban?\"\nAnd I say, \"Yeah.\"\nAnd they say, \"We need\nto talk about your thesis.\"\nAnd I say, \"OK.\"\nAnd they say,\n\"It's the best one we've ever seen.\"\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nThat did not happen.\n(Laughter)\nIt was a very, very bad thesis.\n(Laughter)\nI just wanted to enjoy that one moment\nwhen all of you thought,\n\"This guy is amazing!\"\n(Laughter)\nNo, no, it was very, very bad.\nAnyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.\nI write the blog Wait But Why.\nAnd a couple of years ago,\nI decided to write about procrastination.\nMy behavior has always perplexed\nthe non-procrastinators around me,\nand I wanted to explain\nto the non-procrastinators of the world\nwhat goes on in the heads\nof procrastinators,\nand why we are the way we are.\nNow, I had a hypothesis\nthat the brains of procrastinators\nwere actually different\nthan the brains of other people.\nAnd to test this, I found an MRI lab\nthat actually let me scan both my brain\nand the brain of a proven\nnon-procrastinator,\nso I could compare them.\nI actually brought them here\nto show you today.\nI want you to take a look carefully\nto see if you can notice a difference.\nI know that if you're not\na trained brain expert,\nit's not that obvious,\nbut just take a look, OK?\nSo here's the brain\nof a non-procrastinator.\n(Laughter)\nNow ...\nhere's my brain.\n(Laughter)\nThere is a difference.\nBoth brains have a Rational\nDecision-Maker in them,\nbut the procrastinator's brain\nalso has an Instant Gratification Monkey.\nNow, what does this mean\nfor the procrastinator?\nWell, it means everything's fine\nuntil this happens.\n[This is a perfect time\nto get some work done.] [Nope!]\nSo the Rational Decision-Maker\nwill make the rational decision\nto do something productive,\nbut the Monkey doesn't like that plan,\nso he actually takes the wheel,\nand he says, \"Actually, let's read\nthe entire Wikipedia page\nof the Nancy Kerrigan/\nTonya Harding scandal,\nbecause I just remembered\nthat that happened.\n(Laughter)\nThen --\n(Laughter)\nThen we're going to go over to the fridge,\nto see if there's anything new\nin there since 10 minutes ago.\nAfter that, we're going to go\non a YouTube spiral\nthat starts with videos\nof Richard Feynman talking about magnets\nand ends much, much later\nwith us watching interviews\nwith Justin Bieber's mom.\n(Laughter)\n\"All of that's going to take a while,\nso we're not going to really have room\non the schedule for any work today.\nSorry!\"\n(Sigh)\nNow, what is going on here?\nThe Instant Gratification Monkey\ndoes not seem like a guy\nyou want behind the wheel.\nHe lives entirely in the present moment.\nHe has no memory of the past,\nno knowledge of the future,\nand he only cares about two things:\neasy and fun.\nNow, in the animal world, that works fine.\nIf you're a dog\nand you spend your whole life doing\nnothing other than easy and fun things,\nyou're a huge success!\n(Laughter)\nAnd to the Monkey,\nhumans are just another animal species.\nYou have to keep well-slept, well-fed\nand propagating into the next generation,\nwhich in tribal times\nmight have worked OK.\nBut, if you haven't noticed,\nnow we're not in tribal times.\nWe're in an advanced civilization,\nand the Monkey does not know what that is.\nWhich is why we have\nanother guy in our brain,\nthe Rational Decision-Maker,\nwho gives us the ability to do things\nno other animal can do.\nWe can visualize the future.\nWe can see the big picture.\nWe can make long-term plans.\nAnd he wants to take\nall of that into account.\nAnd he wants to just have us do\nwhatever makes sense\nto be doing right now.\nNow, sometimes it makes sense\nto be doing things that are easy and fun,\nlike when you're having dinner\nor going to bed\nor enjoying well-earned leisure time.\nThat's why there's an overlap.\nSometimes they agree.\nBut other times, it makes much more sense\nto be doing things that are harder\nand less pleasant,\nfor the sake of the big picture.\nAnd that's when we have a conflict.\nAnd for the procrastinator,\nthat conflict tends to end\na certain way every time,\nleaving him spending a lot of time\nin this orange zone,\nan easy and fun place that's entirely\nout of the Makes Sense circle.\nI call it the Dark Playground.\n(Laughter)\nNow, the Dark Playground is a place\nthat all of you procrastinators\nout there know very well.\nIt's where leisure activities happen\nat times when leisure activities\nare not supposed to be happening.\nThe fun you have in the Dark Playground\nisn't actually fun,\nbecause it's completely unearned,\nand the air is filled with guilt,\ndread, anxiety, self-hatred --\nall of those good procrastinator feelings.\nAnd the question is, in this situation,\nwith the Monkey behind the wheel,\nhow does the procrastinator ever get\nhimself over here to this blue zone,\na less pleasant place, but where\nreally important things happen?\nWell, turns out the procrastinator\nhas a guardian angel,\nsomeone who's always looking\ndown on him and watching over him\nin his darkest moments --\nsomeone called the Panic Monster.\n(Laughter)\nNow, the Panic Monster\nis dormant most of the time,\nbut he suddenly wakes up\nanytime a deadline gets too close\nor there's danger of public embarrassment,\na career disaster or some other\nscary consequence.\nAnd importantly, he's the only thing\nthe Monkey is terrified of.\nNow, he became very relevant\nin my life pretty recently,\nbecause the people of TED\nreached out to me about six months ago\nand invited me to do a TED Talk.\n(Laughter)\nNow, of course, I said yes.\nIt's always been a dream of mine\nto have done a TED Talk in the past.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nBut in the middle of all this excitement,\nthe Rational Decision-Maker seemed\nto have something else on his mind.\nHe was saying, \"Are we clear\non what we just accepted?\nDo we get what's going to be now\nhappening one day in the future?\nWe need to sit down\nand work on this right now.\"\nAnd the Monkey said, \"Totally agree,\nbut let's just open Google Earth\nand zoom in to the bottom of India,\nlike 200 feet above the ground,\nand scroll up for two and a half hours\ntil we get to the top of the country,\nso we can get a better feel for India.\"\n(Laughter)\nSo that's what we did that day.\n(Laughter)\nAs six months turned into four\nand then two and then one,\nthe people of TED decided\nto release the speakers.\nAnd I opened up the website,\nand there was my face\nstaring right back at me.\nAnd guess who woke up?\n(Laughter)\nSo the Panic Monster\nstarts losing his mind,\nand a few seconds later,\nthe whole system's in mayhem.\n(Laughter)\nAnd the Monkey -- remember,\nhe's terrified of the Panic Monster --\nboom, he's up the tree!\nAnd finally,\nfinally, the Rational Decision-Maker\ncan take the wheel\nand I can start working on the talk.\nNow, the Panic Monster explains\nall kinds of pretty insane\nprocrastinator behavior,\nlike how someone like me\ncould spend two weeks\nunable to start the opening\nsentence of a paper,\nand then miraculously find\nthe unbelievable work ethic\nto stay up all night\nand write eight pages.\nAnd this entire situation,\nwith the three characters --\nthis is the procrastinator's system.\nIt's not pretty, but in the end, it works.\nThis is what I decided to write about\non the blog a couple of years ago.\nWhen I did, I was amazed by the response.\nLiterally thousands of emails came in,\nfrom all different kinds of people\nfrom all over the world,\ndoing all different kinds of things.\nThese are people who were nurses,\nbankers, painters, engineers\nand lots and lots of PhD students.\n(Laughter)\nAnd they were all writing,\nsaying the same thing:\n\"I have this problem too.\"\nBut what struck me was the contrast\nbetween the light tone of the post\nand the heaviness of these emails.\nThese people were writing\nwith intense frustration\nabout what procrastination\nhad done to their lives,\nabout what this Monkey had done to them.\nAnd I thought about this, and I said,\nwell, if the procrastinator's system\nworks, then what's going on?\nWhy are all of these people\nin such a dark place?\nWell, it turns out that there's\ntwo kinds of procrastination.\nEverything I've talked about today,\nthe examples I've given,\nthey all have deadlines.\nAnd when there's deadlines,\nthe effects of procrastination\nare contained to the short term\nbecause the Panic Monster gets involved.\nBut there's a second kind\nof procrastination\nthat happens in situations\nwhen there is no deadline.\nSo if you wanted a career\nwhere you're a self-starter --\nsomething in the arts,\nsomething entrepreneurial --\nthere's no deadlines on those things\nat first, because nothing's happening,\nnot until you've gone out\nand done the hard work\nto get momentum, get things going.\nThere's also all kinds of important things\noutside of your career\nthat don't involve any deadlines,\nlike seeing your family or exercising\nand taking care of your health,\nworking on your relationship\nor getting out of a relationship\nthat isn't working.\nNow if the procrastinator's only mechanism\nof doing these hard things\nis the Panic Monster, that's a problem,\nbecause in all of these\nnon-deadline situations,\nthe Panic Monster doesn't show up.\nHe has nothing to wake up for,\nso the effects of procrastination,\nthey're not contained;\nthey just extend outward forever.\nAnd it's this long-term\nkind of procrastination\nthat's much less visible\nand much less talked about\nthan the funnier, short-term\ndeadline-based kind.\nIt's usually suffered\nquietly and privately.\nAnd it can be the source\nof a huge amount of long-term\nunhappiness, and regrets.\nAnd I thought, that's why\nthose people are emailing,\nand that's why they're\nin such a bad place.\nIt's not that they're cramming\nfor some project.\nIt's that long-term procrastination\nhas made them feel like a spectator,\nat times, in their own lives.\nThe frustration is not\nthat they couldn't achieve their dreams;\nit's that they weren't even\nable to start chasing them.\nSo I read these emails\nand I had a little bit of an epiphany --\nthat I don't think\nnon-procrastinators exist.\nThat's right -- I think all of you\nare procrastinators.\nNow, you might not all be a mess,\nlike some of us,\n(Laughter)\nand some of you may have\na healthy relationship with deadlines,\nbut remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick\nis when the deadlines aren't there.\nNow, I want to show you one last thing.\nI call this a Life Calendar.\nThat's one box for every week\nof a 90-year life.\nThat's not that many boxes,\nespecially since we've already\nused a bunch of those.\nSo I think we need to all take a long,\nhard look at that calendar.\nWe need to think about what\nwe're really procrastinating on,\nbecause everyone is procrastinating\non something in life.\nWe need to stay aware\nof the Instant Gratification Monkey.\nThat's a job for all of us.\nAnd because there's not\nthat many boxes on there,\nit's a job that should\nprobably start today.\nWell, maybe not today, but ...\n(Laughter)\nYou know.\nSometime soon.\nThank you.\n(Applause) (translated to es)",

talk author and\ninspirational speaker simon sinek\nexplains the power of knowing your why\nby why i mean what's your purpose what's\nyour cause what's your belief\nwhy does your organization exist\nwhy do you get out of bed in the morning\nand why should anyone care\nwell as a result the way we think the\nway we act the way we communicate is\nfrom the outside in it's obvious we go\nfrom the clearest thing to the fuzziest\nthing\nlet me give you an example i use apple\nbecause they're easy to understand and\neverybody gets it\nif apple were like everyone else\na marketing message from them might\nsound like this\nwe make great computers\nthey're beautifully designed simple to\nuse and user friendly\nwant to buy one\nbut it's uninspiring here's how apple\nactually communicates\neverything we do\nwe believe\nin challenging the status quo we believe\nin thinking differently\nthe way we challenge the status quo is\nby making our products beautifully\ndesigned simple to use and user friendly\nwe just happen to make great computers\nwant to buy one\ntotally different right you're ready to\nbuy a computer from me\n[Music]\nwhy does your organization exist\nwhy do you get out of bed in the morning\nalthough simon sinek uses apple as an\nexample this applies to individuals as\nwell when we understand why we do\nanything our purpose becomes clear and\nwe can more easily work towards it here\nwhen we talk about what gets you out of\nbed in the morning it means what is your\npurpose and motivation in life\nwhat motivates you to go to work each\nday an expression that sounds similar\nbut has a totally different meaning is\nto wake up on the right or wrong side of\nthe bed which is used for saying that\nsomeone is in a good or bad mood for\nexample he seems very grumpy today it\nseems he woke up on the wrong side of\nthe bed so what's something you do every\nmorning without fail\noh unfortunately i checked my phone same\nhere yeah what gets you out of bed\nmy dog noon cute we go from the clearest\nthing to the fuzziest thing in this\ncontext when we refer to an idea or\nconcept as fuzzy we mean that it is\nstill unclear or undeveloped as you\nhaven't yet given it enough thought for\nexample he wants to start his own\nbusiness but his business plan is still\na bit fuzzy\nwhich of these pictures also represents\nthe meaning of fuzzy\nthe slippers and rabbit are fuzzy\nbecause they are covered with short soft\nfur and in english we call this fuzzy\nthe display screen is fuzzy because the\nimage is not clear making it difficult\nto see\new oh ew\ngross\nidiot\nstupid little fuzzy yellow creature\noh look at me i'm so cute i'm a little\nchick who's disgusting\ndo you want to be able to watch\nabsolutely any movie or tv series\nwithout needing subtitles if\nunderstanding the jokes culture and\nevery word is important to you then our\nfree three-part masterclass is just what\nyou need to speak english more naturally\nand confidently\nsimply sign up now by clicking up here\nor down in the description below\nthey're beautifully designed simple to\nuse and user friendly this is a word\nthat you might hear related to software\nand technology you can use the word\nuser-friendly to describe something that\nis simple or easy for people to use or\nlearn\nmy new computer came with windows 7.\nwindows 7 is much more user-friendly\nthan windows vista\ni don't like that\neverything we do\nwe believe\nin challenging the status quo\nthe word status quo is a latin phrase\nthat is still used today mostly in\nformal or academic situations however\nit's perfectly normal to use it in\neveryday conversations\nwe use it to mean the present situation\nor the way things usually are lewis said\ni'm not allowed to prioritize your work\nanymore you think i'm taking orders from\nlewis now\nconsider things status quo yeah well\nthey aren't\nthey are as far as you and i are\nconcerned we just happen to make great\ncomputers\nwe use the phrase happen to plus verb to\nsay that something happened by chance or\nwithout preparation for example he\nhappens to be best friends with his\nboss's daughter hi\nhi isaac isaac hi\nyou know we haven't actually met your\ndog\nyes i suppose i am a dog\nbut isaac see i i happen to have a\ngirlfriend oh fry that rachel chick from\nthe coffee place yeah that's the one we\njust happen to make great computers\nwant to buy one\nnotice how simon uses connected speech\nhere instead of asking want to buy one\nthe words one and two flow into each\nother so the t sound at the end of want\nand at the beginning of two are silent\nso all we hear is wanna together this\nsounds like wanna buy one\nto buy one\n[Music]\nthe next step is to accept the fact that\nmistakes and vulnerability are part of\nlearning a new language\nin this powerful ted talk renee brown\ntalks about the power of vulnerability\nalmost simply put the power of embracing\npossible mistakes and failure the one\nthing that keeps us out of connection is\nour fear that we're not worthy of\nconnection\ni\ntook all of the interviews where i saw\nworthiness where i saw people living\nthat way and just looked at those\nwhat they had in common was a sense of\ncourage\nand so these folks had very simply the\ncourage to be imperfect\nthey had the compassion\nto be kind to themselves first and then\nto others the other thing that they had\nin common\nthey fully embraced vulnerability\nthey talked about the willingness\nto say i love you first\nthe willingness\nto do something where there are no\nguarantees\nthe one thing that keeps us out of\nconnection is our fear that we're not\nworthy of connection the word worthy has\nseveral meanings in this context it\nmeans that someone deserves respect\nadmiration or support\nyou must be so proud to have him as your\nbrother\nwell truth be told he does bring me a\nlot of joy\nthank you for telling me this charlie\nyou're welcome\njust promise me you won't embarrass him\nby bringing it up oh not a word\ni just hope i can be worthy of him\nas a suffix at the end of a word it can\nalso mean suitable or deserving for\nexample road plus the suffix worthy\nmakes road worthy which means that\nsomething usually a vehicle is suitable\nto be used on the road trust plus the\nsuffix worthy makes trustworthy which\nmeans that someone can be trusted for\nexample\nhe is a very trustworthy employee\nwhat they had in common was a sense of\ncourage\nand so these folks had very simply the\ncourage to be imperfect\nwe say that people have something in\ncommon when they share similar interests\nor characteristics\nhe obviously went crazy\nobviously lost his mind\nwell i didn't lose my mind\nokay janice and i have a lot in common\nwe've we've both been divorced we we\nboth have kids the word folks can be\nused in different ways\nwe use it to refer to people in general\nfor example folks need to realize that\nglobal warming is a reality we use it to\nrefer to people of a particular group\nthat area is very popular amongst rich\nfolks\nfolks also refers to your parents\ni'm going home over thanksgiving to see\nmy folks you can say folks if you want\nto speak in a friendly way to people you\ndon't know for example\nwell folks thanks for watching channel 5\nnews\nthey had the compassion\nto be kind to themselves first and then\nto others compassion is a positive word\nthat refers to a strong feeling of\nsympathy and sadness for the suffering\nor bad luck of others and wish to help\nthem the other thing that they had in\ncommon\nthey fully embraced vulnerability\nin this situation embrace is a synonym\nfor accepting something\nwell i think it's great that you're\ngoing on a date you know i mean it\nsounds healthy i mean you have needs\nembrace your womanhood\nhowever to embrace can also mean to hold\nsomeone tightly with both arms to\nexpress love\nliking or sympathy or when greeting or\nleaving someone for example the boy\nembraced his mother to show his\ngratitude they talked about the\nwillingness\nto say i love you first\nthe noun willingness means that the\nperson is ready and voluntarily wants to\ndo something you could also change the\nsentence structure slightly by using the\nadjective willing\nso instead of they talked about the\nwillingness to say i love you first you\ncould say they talked about being\nwilling to say i love you first as they\nhave the same meaning\nthank you all for assembling at such\nshort notice\nand i want to thank you\nfor your willingness to serve\n[Music]\none of the main reasons many learners\nstudy english is that it is a global\nlanguage in order to truly become a\nglobal citizen we need to be open to\nunderstanding the world from different\nperspectives in this ted talk chimamanda\nngozi adichie explains why this is\nimportant\nyears later i thought about this when i\nleft nigeria to go to university in the\nunited states i was 19.\nmy american roommate was shocked by me\nshe asked where i had learned to speak\nenglish so well and was confused when i\nsaid that nigeria happened to have\nenglish as its official language\nshe asked if she could listen to what\nshe called my tribal music\ni was consequently very disappointed\nwhen i produced my tape of mariah carey\nmy roommate had a single story of africa\na single story of catastrophe\nin this single story there was no\npossibility of africans being similar to\nher in any way no possibility of\nfeelings more complex than pity no\npossibility of a connection as human\nequals\nso that is how to create a single story\nshow a people\nas one thing as only one thing over and\nover again and that is what they become\n[Music]\nshe asked if she could listen to what\nshe called my tribal music\nhere tribal music refers to the music\ncreated by indigenous people of a\nparticular area who belong to a specific\ntribe it is music that is special and\nsymbolic of the culture\ni was consequently very disappointed\nwhen i produced my tape of mariah carey\nthe word consequently is often used in\nwriting and means the same as therefore\nor as a result of something last year\nyou bet me that you could steal my medal\nof valor and you did consequently i was\nforced to do your paperwork for a week\nand to say words i thought i'd never\nhave to say i was consequently very\ndisappointed when i produced my tape of\nmariah carey when she refers to her tape\nshe means a cassette tape which is a\nflat rectangular object used for playing\nand recording audio\ncassette tapes were popular in the 1980s\nand 90s\nfor dinner music i thought we could\nlisten to that tape that you made me oh\nthe mixtape\nthis is quite humorous because she's\nsaying that the music that is symbolic\nof her culture or tribe is from\ninternational superstar mariah carey\nmy roommate had a single story of africa\nthe word single means one so when she\ntalks about a single story she means\nthat her roommate only understood one\npart of the story or she only had\nlimited information about africa and\nthis became how she viewed the entire\ncontinent we use the word catastrophe to\nrefer to a bad situation or an event\nthat causes very great trouble or\ndestruction\nshow a people\nas one thing when we talk about a people\nit might sound incorrect but in fact it\nrefers to a nation a tribe a community\nthat is regarded as a single unit\nso that brings this lesson to an end but\nbefore you go let's do a quick quiz to\nsee how much you've learned but it's\nuninspiring here's how apple actually\ncommunicates\neverything we do\nwe believe\nin challenging the status quo we believe\nin thinking differently\nthe way we challenge the status quo is\nby making our products beautifully\ndesigned simple to use and user friendly\nwe just happen to make great computers\nwant to buy one\ntotally different right you're ready to\nbuy a computer from me\nwhat is the opposite of status quo\nunusual\nregular\natypical\n[Music]\nthey had the compassion\nto be kind to themselves first and then\nto others the other thing that they had\nin common\nthey fully embraced vulnerability\nthey talked about the willingness\nto say i love you first\nthe willingness to\ndo something where there are no\nguarantees\nwhich of these pictures shows the verb\nembrace\n[Music]\n[Music]\nyears later i thought about this when i\nleft nigeria to go to university in the\nunited states i was 19.\nmy american roommate was shocked by me\nshe asked where i had learned to speak\nenglish so well and was confused when i\nsaid that nigeria happened to have\nenglish as its official language\nshe asked if she could listen to what\nshe called my tribal music\ni was consequently very disappointed\nwhen i produced my tape of mariah carey\nwhich of these means the same as\nconsequently\nvulnerability\nwhy\ntherefore\nif you enjoyed this lesson then be sure\nto check out this one we recently did on\nphrasal verbs\nhey real lifers so i just got to work\nand i was about to start my tasks when i\nrealized i haven't signed in yet so to\nsign in means to insert a username and\npassword in order to gain access to a\ndevice such as your computer or your\nphone\nyou could also use the word login\nso sign in and log in have the same\nmeaning\nnow that i've organized my tasks i'm\ngoing to start working on an urgent\nproject that my boss assigned to me",
